## üìã **Detailed Documentation Sections**

### **‚úÖ AI Grading Documentation**

**Scoring Algorithm Explanation:**
```markdown
Formula: Final Score = (0.7 √ó Semantic Similarity) + (0.3 √ó Keyword Coverage)

Semantic Similarity (70% weight):
- Uses sentence-transformers for embeddings
- Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Cosine similarity between student and model answers
- Range: 0.0 to 1.0

Keyword Coverage (30% weight):
- Case-insensitive exact matching
- Calculation: (Matched keywords) / (Total keywords)
- Example: 3/5 keywords = 0.6 coverage
```

**Concrete Scoring Example:**
```markdown
Student Answer: "Plants use chlorophyll to capture sunlight and make food"
Model Answer: "Plants use chlorophyll to capture light energy and convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through photosynthesis"
Rubric Keywords: ["chlorophyll", "sunlight", "carbon dioxide", "oxygen", "photosynthesis"]

Semantic Similarity: 0.75 (good conceptual understanding)
Keyword Coverage: 2/5 = 0.4 (chlorophyll, sunlight matched)

Final Score: (0.7 √ó 0.75) + (0.3 √ó 0.4) = 0.525 + 0.12 = 0.645 (64.5%)
```

### **‚úÖ Recommendations Documentation**

**Algorithm Explanation:**
```markdown
Hybrid Algorithm: Combines skill-based (60%) and content-based (40%) scoring

Weak Skills Analysis:
- Identifies student areas of difficulty from assignment performance
- Computes skill mastery scores from response history
- Prioritizes lessons matching weak skill areas

Content Similarity:
- Uses embeddings to find semantically similar lessons
- Considers recent student activity and lesson content
- Provides fallback when no weak skills identified

Explanation Generation:
- Clear "why" explanations for each recommendation
- References specific performance areas
- Suggests learning objectives and benefits
```

### **‚úÖ Misconception Insights Documentation**

**Clustering Process:**
```markdown
1. Data Collection: Gathers responses with AI scores below threshold (0.7)
2. Embedding Generation: Converts student answers to numerical vectors
3. Clustering: Uses KMeans to group similar responses (max 3 clusters)
4. Pattern Analysis: Identifies common themes and keywords
5. Insight Generation: Creates actionable teaching recommendations
```

**Cluster Interpretation:**
```markdown
Cluster Label: "Confusion about photosynthesis inputs and outputs"
Example Responses: ["Plants eat sunlight and breathe in oxygen to make food"]
Suggested Skill Tags: ["photosynthesis", "carbon_dioxide", "oxygen"]
Student Count: 3 students with this misconception
```
