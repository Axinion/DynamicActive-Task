    "student_answer": "Plants use chlorophyll to capture sunlight energy and convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. This process occurs in the chloroplasts and requires sunlight as the energy source.",
    "model_answer": "Plants use chlorophyll to capture light energy from the sun and convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through photosynthesis. This process occurs in chloroplasts and requires sunlight as an energy source.",
    "rubric_keywords": ["chlorophyll", "sunlight", "carbon dioxide", "oxygen", "photosynthesis", "glucose"]
}

# Expected: score > 0.7, matched_keywords >= 4, meaningful explanation
```

**Weak Answer Example:**
```python
weak_answer_data = {
    "student_answer": "Plants make food using light. They need water and air.",
    "model_answer": "Plants use chlorophyll to capture light energy from the sun and convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through photosynthesis. This process occurs in chloroplasts and requires sunlight as an energy source.",
    "rubric_keywords": ["chlorophyll", "sunlight", "carbon dioxide", "oxygen", "photosynthesis", "glucose"]
}

# Expected: score < 0.7, matched_keywords < 4, constructive feedback
```

### **âœ… Assignment Submission Scenarios**

**Complete Submission Example:**
```python
submission_data = {
    "answers": [
        {
            "question_id": mcq_question.id,
            "answer": "Chlorophyll"  # Correct MCQ
        },
        {
            "question_id": short_question.id,
            "answer": "Plants use chlorophyll to capture sunlight and convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through photosynthesis."
        }
    ]
}

# Expected: ai_score ~0.9, MCQ score 1.0, short score ~0.8, matched_keywords present
```

**Weak Performance Example:**
```python
submission_data = {
    "answers": [
        {
            "question_id": mcq_question.id,
            "answer": "Chlorophyll"  # Correct MCQ
        },
        {
            "question_id": short_question.id,
            "answer": "Plants make food using light."  # Weak short answer
        }
    ]
}

# Expected: ai_score ~0.5, MCQ score 1.0, short score ~0.3, fewer matched_keywords
```

### **âœ… Recommendations Scenarios**

**Weak Skills Example:**
```python
# Student has low scores in photosynthesis and chlorophyll
# System should recommend lessons with these skill tags
# Expected: recommendations include "Introduction to Photosynthesis" lesson
# Reason: "You struggled with photosynthesis concepts in your recent assignment. This lesson covers the key processes and terminology you need to master."
```

**No Weak Skills Example:**
```python
# Student has high scores across all skills
# System should return content-based recommendations
# Expected: recommendations based on lesson similarity and availability
# Reason: "This lesson builds on the topics you've been studying and will prepare you for upcoming assignments."
```

### **âœ… Misconceptions Scenarios**

**Common Misconceptions Example:**
```python
misconceptions_data = [
    {
        "answer": "Plants eat sunlight and breathe in oxygen to make food",
        "ai_score": 0.2
    },
    {
        "answer": "Plants take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide like animals",
        "ai_score": 0.1
    },
    {
        "answer": "Plants just store sunlight in their leaves for later use",
        "ai_score": 0.3
    }
]

# Expected: 1-2 clusters identified
# Cluster 1: "Confusion about photosynthesis inputs and outputs"
# Examples: ["Plants eat sunlight and breathe in oxygen to make food", "Plants take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide like animals"]
# Suggested skills: ["photosynthesis", "carbon_dioxide", "oxygen"]
```

### **âœ… Teacher Override Scenarios**

**Response Override Example:**
```python
override_data = {
    "teacher_score": 0.8,
    "teacher_feedback": "Student shows good understanding of the basic concept, but could improve on details."
}

# Expected: teacher_score updated to 0.8, teacher_feedback added, ai_score unchanged
```

**Submission Override Example:**
```python
override_data = {
    "teacher_score": 85
}

# Expected: teacher_score updated to 85, ai_score unchanged, audit trail maintained
```
