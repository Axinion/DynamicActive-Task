**2. Teacher Help Guide (`docs/insights.md`):**
```markdown
# ðŸ“Š Teacher Insights & Analytics Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
The Insights tab provides teachers with powerful analytics to understand student learning patterns, identify common misconceptions, and track skill development over time.

## ðŸ“ˆ Misconception Clustering
### What Are Misconception Clusters?
Misconception clusters are groups of similar incorrect or low-scoring student responses that reveal common misunderstanding patterns.

### How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Analyzes all student responses with scores below the passing threshold
2. **AI Clustering**: Uses KMeans clustering to group similar responses together
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common themes and misunderstanding patterns
4. **Smart Labeling**: Generates descriptive labels from frequent keywords in responses

### Understanding the Display
Each misconception cluster shows:
- **Rank Badge**: Numbered 1-3 based on frequency and impact
- **Cluster Label**: Descriptive name generated from common keywords
- **Response Count**: How many students had this misconception
- **Example Answers**: 1-2 sample student responses showing the misconception
- **Suggested Mini-Lessons**: Direct links to relevant lessons for remediation

## ðŸ“Š Skill Mastery Tracking
### What Is Skill Mastery?
Skill mastery represents a student's proficiency level (0-100%) in specific skill areas based on their performance across all assignments.

### How Mastery Is Calculated
**For Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)**:
- Correct answer = 1.0 (100%)
- Incorrect answer = 0.0 (0%)

**For Short Answer Questions**:
- Uses teacher score if available
- Otherwise uses AI score (0-1 scale)
- Scores are averaged across all responses for each skill

### Understanding Mastery Levels
**ðŸ”´ Needs Practice (0-49%)**: Significant gaps in understanding
**ðŸŸ¡ Growing (50-79%)**: Developing understanding
**ðŸŸ¢ Strong (80-100%)**: Solid understanding

## ðŸŽ“ Mini-Lesson Suggestions
### What Are Mini-Lesson Suggestions?
Mini-lesson suggestions are automatically curated lesson recommendations based on student misconceptions or weak skills.

### How Suggestions Work
**Tag-Based Matching**:
- Exact matches: Lessons with identical skill tags
- Partial matches: Lessons with related skill tags
- Recency priority: Newer lessons ranked first

**Weak Skill Integration**:
- Automatically suggests lessons for skills with mastery < 60%
- Helps students improve in specific areas
- Provides targeted practice opportunities
```

## ðŸ”Œ **API Integration**

### **âœ… Test Data Setup**

**1. Misconceptions Test Data:**
```python
# Create low-scoring responses for clustering
response1 = Response(
    submission_id=submission.id,
    question_id=question1.id,
    student_answer="Plants eat sunlight",  # Misconception
    ai_score=0.2  # Low score
)
response2 = Response(
    submission_id=submission.id,
    question_id=question2.id,
    student_answer="red",  # Wrong MCQ answer
    ai_score=0.0  # Incorrect
)
```

**2. Progress Test Data:**
```python
# Create responses with different skill tags
question1 = Question(
    assignment_id=assignment.id,
    type="short",
    prompt="What is 2+2?",
    answer_key="4",
    skill_tags=["arithmetic"]  # Tag A
)
question2 = Question(
    assignment_id=assignment.id,
    type="short",
    prompt="What is photosynthesis?",
    answer_key="Process by which plants convert light energy",
    skill_tags=["photosynthesis"]  # Tag B
)
```

**3. Mini-Lessons Test Data:**
```python
# Create lessons with different skill tags
lesson1 = Lesson(
    class_id=test_class.id,
    title="Introduction to Photosynthesis",
    content="Photosynthesis is the process...",
    skill_tags=["photosynthesis", "plant_biology"]
)
lesson2 = Lesson(
    class_id=test_class.id,
    title="Advanced Photosynthesis Concepts",
    content="Chlorophyll and light absorption...",
    skill_tags=["photosynthesis", "chlorophyll"]
)
```

### **âœ… Assertion Patterns**

**1. Response Structure Validation:**
```python
# Check response structure
assert "class_id" in data
assert "class_name" in data
assert "period" in data
assert "time_window" in data
assert "total_items" in data
assert "clusters" in data
assert "analysis_summary" in data
```

**2. Data Integrity Checks:**
```python
# Check clusters
clusters = data["clusters"]
assert isinstance(clusters, list)
assert len(clusters) <= 3  # Should have at most 3 clusters

# Check each cluster structure
for cluster in clusters:
    assert "label" in cluster
    assert "examples" in cluster
    assert "suggested_skill_tags" in cluster
    assert "cluster_size" in cluster
    assert "common_keywords" in cluster
```

**3. Calculation Accuracy:**
```python
# Check mastery calculations
assert arithmetic_skill["mastery"] == 1.0  # (1.0 + 1.0) / 2 = 1.0
assert photosynthesis_skill["mastery"] == 0.5  # 0.5 / 1 = 0.5
assert multiplication_skill["mastery"] == 1.0  # 1.0 / 1 = 1.0

# Check overall mastery
expected_overall = (1.0 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0) / 4  # 0.875
assert abs(data["overall_mastery_avg"] - expected_overall) < 0.001
```
